# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18 using Vite as the build tool and bundler. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing a consistent and accessible design system. TailwindCSS handles all styling with a custom dark theme configuration. The application uses wouter for client-side routing and TanStack Query for server state management with optimistic updates and caching.

The component structure follows a modular approach with separate directories for UI components, layout components, charts, and feature-specific components (portfolio, watchlist, alpha signals, news). Form handling is managed through react-hook-form with Zod schema validation for type safety.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js running on Node.js with TypeScript for type safety. The server follows a layered architecture pattern with separate modules for routes, services, storage, and middleware. The API provides RESTful endpoints for authentication, portfolio management, watchlist operations, market data, and sentiment analysis.

Key services include:
- Stock API service for real-time market data integration
- Sentiment analysis service using OpenAI GPT-5 for news sentiment scoring
- Alpha signature service that combines sentiment, volatility, and momentum into proprietary scoring algorithms
- Behavioral bias analyzer with rule-based and ML algorithms for detecting cognitive biases
- AI chat analysis service for personalized investment advice and portfolio insights
- Market trend analysis service providing bullish/bearish recommendations with confidence scoring
- Authentication middleware using JWT tokens for secure user sessions

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The database schema includes tables for users, portfolio holdings, watchlist items, sentiment data, alpha signatures, stock prices, and behavioral analysis data. Neon is used as the PostgreSQL provider for serverless database hosting.

Database relationships are properly defined with foreign key constraints and cascading deletes. The schema uses UUIDs for primary keys and includes proper indexing for performance optimization. Behavioral analysis data includes transaction history tracking for bias detection algorithms.

## Authentication and Authorization
JWT-based authentication system handles user registration and login. Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs with salt rounds for security. The authentication middleware validates JWT tokens on protected routes and attaches user context to requests. Tokens are stored in localStorage on the client side with automatic inclusion in API requests.
